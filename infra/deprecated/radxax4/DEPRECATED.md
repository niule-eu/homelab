# Deprecated: radxax4 Configuration

**Status**: DEPRECATED

This directory contains configuration for the radxax4 node which is being migrated to a new configuration system. The configuration is being retained for reference but should not be modified.

## Replacement

The radxax4 node configuration is being moved to `infra/nodes/on-premise/radxax4.pkl` following the new node configuration convention. Please use the new configuration location for any updates.

## Migration Notes

- New configuration follows the base model defined in `infra/nodes/model/Base.pkl`
- Configuration management is now centralized in the `infra/nodes/` directory
